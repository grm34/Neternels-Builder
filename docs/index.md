# Overview

ZenMaxBuilder (ZMB) is an Android Kernel Builder written in bash, which can be runned on any compatible Linux System (feel free to Pull Request for Windows support). By default it uses Proton-Clang, Eva-GCC, Proton-GCC or Lineage-GCC but you can use any Clang or GCC toolchains you like (with LLVM and binutils included). Find all your compilations and working folders in one place, edit and maintain your kernels faster. Full logs with the possibility to restart the build after error. Automatic creation of a flashable signed ZIP (with AK3 and AOSP Keys). Real time status feedback with ZIP sending on any group or Telegram channel. And more. The perfect tool to compile on the fly and keep fresh and clean kernel paths.

<br>
# Requirements

A computer running Linux, the source code of the phone kernel, a minimum of knowledge in kernel compilation and a lot of patience.

The installation of the missing dependencies will be offered by ZenMaxBuilder but you can also install them manually with your favorite package manager:

    bash sed wget git curl zip tar expect make cmake automake autoconf llvm lld lldb clang gcc binutils bison perl libtool gperf gawk flex bc python zstd ninja openssl

The optional flashable zip signature with AOSP Keys requires java (JDK) which is not proposed to install by ZenMaxBuilder (openjdk recommended).

<br>
# Usage

âž¡ Clone and enter ZMB repository

    git clone https://github.com/grm34/ZenMaxBuilder;
    cd ZenMaxBuilder

âž¡ Create a copy of [settings.cfg](https://github.com/grm34/ZenMaxBuilder/blob/zmb/etc/settings.cfg) to set your settings (optional)

    cp etc/settings.cfg etc/user.cfg;
    vi etc/user.cfg

âž¡ Start ZMB and follow instructions

    bash zmb --start

<br>
# Options

    Usage: bash zmb [OPTION] [ARGUMENT] (e.g. bash zmb --start)

    Options
        -h, --help                      show this message and exit
        -s, --start                     start new kernel compilation
        -u, --update                    update script and toolchains
        -l, --list                      show list of your kernels
        -t, --tag            [v4.19]    show the latest Linux tag
        -m, --msg          [message]    send message on Telegram
        -f, --file            [file]    send file on Telegram
        -z, --zip     [Image.gz-dtb]    create flashable zip
        -d, --debug                     start compilation in debug mode

# Warning

ZMB is a tool to facilitate the compilation of the Android kernel, it does not touch at your kernel source and does not adds possible modifications that must be made, except the setting of CROSS_COMPILE in the main Makefile (all others toolchain options from ZMB settings will be passed directly to make as command-line argument):

    # Proton-Clang / Proton-GCC
    CROSS_COMPILE ?= aarch64-linux-gnu-
    CC             = clang

    # Eva-GCC
    CROSS_COMPILE ?= aarch64-elf-
    CC             = aarch64-elf-gcc

    # Lineage-GCC
    CROSS_COMPILE ?= aarch64-linux-android-
    CC             = aarch64-linux-android-gcc

Kernel sources are often configured for a specific compilation (vendor, firmware, modules, android version, compiler) and little changes are often necessary.
